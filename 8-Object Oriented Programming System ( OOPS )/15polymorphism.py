# Polymorphism :
# Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and operator overloading.

# Operator Overloading
# Operator overloading is a feature that allows us to define the behavior of operators for user-defined classes.
# It enables us to use standard operators like +, -, *, /, etc., with objects of our classes.
# This can make our code more intuitive and easier to read.
# In Python, we can overload operators by defining special methods in our classes. These special methods are also known as dunder (double underscore) methods.
# For example, we can overload the + operator by defining the __add__ method in our class. When we use the + operator with objects of that class, Python will automatically call the __add__ method.
