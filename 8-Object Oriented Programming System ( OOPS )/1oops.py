# OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
# OOPS is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code.
# It allows for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code more modular and reusable.
# OOPS is widely used in many programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and Ruby.
# In Python, everything is an object, including functions and classes.
# This means that you can create your own classes and define their behavior using methods.
# OOPS is a powerful tool for building complex applications and systems.
# It allows for better organization of code, making it easier to read and maintain.
# OOPS also promotes code reuse, which can save time and effort in development.
# In this section, we will explore the key concepts of OOPS, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
